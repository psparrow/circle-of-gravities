Circle of Gravities
===================

I am a huge fan of the band Phish, especially guitarist Trey Anastasio.  If you're familiar with their music, you might have noticed that a good portion of their jams are built on tension and release.  They build around a certain note, chord, or scale for an extended period of time and then converge onto another key.

I found the audio from a guitar workshop that Trey instructed in 1993 on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGCzXQUFqIo.  In the clip, Trey mentions that his guitar instructor, Ted Dunbar, devised a system of 24 scales designed to build tension.  Dunbar refers to the scales as "gravities" as they pull towards the overall key center.  He published the system in his book "A System of Tonal Convergence for Improvisers Composers and Arrangers."  The book contains the 24 scales transcribed to resolve to the key of F major along with information on what chords can be derived from the scales.  It can be found at http://www.scribd.com/doc/144792787/Ted-Dunbar-A-System-of-Tonal-Convergence. 

I recently learned the first 12 scales.  However, when I started moving them to different positions and looking at the notes, I found some redundancy.  Some of the pentatonic (5-note) scales were contained within the 7 and 8-note scales.  Also, some of the other scales were exactly the same but shifted to a different starting note.  

I was able to condense the first 12 scales down to only 6.  I left them in the original keys so as to resolve to F major.  I also tabbed them out to start on a C, the 5th note above F.  I plan expand this repository to contain the other 12 scales in the near future.

Enjoy!
